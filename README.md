# Project Title:E-Commerce Website
### Editor-
So the first thing you'll need is an editor to edit your jazz. There's tons of options out there.

1.Notepad/TextEdit (that's right, the stupid thing that comes on your computer) - This is about as basic as you can get. It's totally okay if you want to use this, but I recommend one of the editors below just so you can see code highlighting (which will help you out later on). But, if you want to be a purist, this'll work just fine. 

2.Visual Studio Code - This is what I typically use. It's open source and has TONS of extensions available. 

3.Sublime Text - This is a pretty popular option. Very clean interface.
